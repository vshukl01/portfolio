            <p><em>
                NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Apriori Algorithm   | Jun. 2023 - Jul. 2023   <a href="https://github.com/vshukl01/Mobile-User-Behavior" target="_blank">[code]</a></em></p>

                <span>&#8226;</span> 
                To ensure optimal model performance, the dataset underwent a thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline. Missing values and outliers were handled to maintain data integrity, followed by binning, encoding (one-hot, label encoding), and feature scaling (MinMax, Standard Scaler) to improve model accuracy. Key behavioral features such as battery drain, screen-on time, and demographic details were extracted, providing valuable insights into user interactions with mobile devices. These preprocessing steps helped create a structured and meaningful dataset, setting a strong foundation for clustering and classification models.
                <br>
                <span>&#8226;</span>
                To uncover hidden patterns in user behavior, K-Means Clustering was applied to segment mobile users based on their activity patterns, such as battery consumption, screen time, and app usage. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate grouping. Additionally, Association Rule Mining with the Apriori Algorithm was implemented to identify strong correlations between user activities, such as the impact of prolonged screen time on battery drain. These insights help businesses and developers optimize user experience, allocate resources efficiently, and tailor recommendations based on behavioral trends.
                <br>
                <span>&#8226;</span>
                For predictive modeling, a Decision Tree Classifier was developed to categorize user behavior based on extracted features, achieving an 80% accuracy in classification. The model was evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring its reliability in predicting different user behavior classes. This classification framework provides a scalable solution for battery management optimization, personalized mobile experiences, and predictive analytics, enabling mobile applications to make data-driven decisions for enhancing user engagement and device efficiency.
